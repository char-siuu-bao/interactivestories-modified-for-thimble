Thanks for registering for the upcoming Ladies Learning Code workshop! There is no need to print a ticket or confirmation - we'll check you in electronically the day of the workshop.
 
We want to be able to dive right in and start learning at the workshop so there are a few things you need to prepare in advance below. Reminder, this workshop is BYOL so be sure to bring a laptop, power cord and computer mouse (if you're more comfortable using one than a trackpad).
 
HOW TO PREPARE:
 
1. Download Google Chrome: To download Chrome, go here:http://www.google.com/chrome
2. Download Atom Editor: http://atom.io (Sublime Text or Text Wrangler work okay, too!)
3. Download the Learner Materials here: https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/llc-interactive-stories-and-game-making/archive/master.zip
 

4. Brainstorm some game/quiz/story ideas so we can dive right in at the workshop. Weâ€™ll also have some time on the day of to do a little brainstorm and idea refining. Here are some of our favorite examples for inspiration:
